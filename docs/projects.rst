Projects
========

Any data set that is loaded in TriFusion (be it proteomes or alignments)
can be saved as a *Project*, which allows it to be quickly loaded in future
separate sessions. As soon as TriFusion opens, it displays a list of previously
save project for quick loading.

Save a data set as a project
----------------------------

Once a particular data set has been loaded into TriFusion, navigate to
``Menu -> Project Management`` and click the ``Save current project`` button.
Provide a unique and descriptive name for your project and click ``Ok``.

Saved projects will be stored and listed in this sub-menu of the side panel,
besides the list in the Home screen of TriFusion. A small label will be
associated with each project: A ``O`` label represents an **Orthology**
project (proteomes), whereas a ``P`` label represents a **Process** and
**Statistics** project (sequence alignments).

Load a project
--------------

There are two places where saved projects can be loaded. In the home
screen of TriFusion, there is a *Quick Open Project* box:

Alternatively, navigating to ``Menu -> Project Management`` will also list
the projects in the side panel:
